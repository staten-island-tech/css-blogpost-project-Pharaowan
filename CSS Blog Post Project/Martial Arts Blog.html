    <div><h1 class="omega">Martial Arts and their Evolution</h1> 
        </div> 
 <div> <p>Martial Arts has changed from the beginnning of time. From when the first human threw the first punch or kick. Martial Arts have evolved to make winning fights and battles easier.It has also lead people to create weapons out of stone and soon metal. As people have improved technology, so has Martial Arts in all aspects.   </p>  </div>
    <div><h2 class="alpha">Hand to Hand Combat</h2> <p>In the beginnning, humans did not know how to use objects as weapons, so they used their limbs as their weapons. From punches to kicks to all the manner of different strikes that exist today. This has continued to evolve to today with all the different hand to hand Martial Arts variations. From Karate, to Aikido to Kung Fu and of course Boxing. </p> <a href="https://www.oldest.org/sports/martial-arts/"> Oldest Martial Arts</a> </div>
    <div><h3 class="beta">Metal Weaponry</h3> <p>As time progressed, people started to make weaponry from stones and then metal.And soon people came across the best metal for weapons, carbon steel This metal is the perfect balance of flexibility in a weapon while also mantaining a rigid shape and being able to maintain a shape if it needs to.</p> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/8330589.Miyamoto_Musashi"> Wisdom from the Past</a> </div> 
    <div><h4 class="gamma">Back to the Past</h4> <p>In the modern world, less and less people have kept up Martial Arts in pursue of simple techniques. There has also been a decline of Martial Arts weapon masters. This is due to to some governments in the past trying to destroy Martial Arts Dojos. Some people may consider guns a part of Martial Arts but I don't believe they should be. Guns don't recquire a good overall form like the martia larts of the past and guns in general are too emotional of a weapon to use. </p> <a href="https://www.ufc.com/"> Modern Day Fighting </a> </div>
